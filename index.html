    <h1>Understanding Memory: Implicit & Explicit</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Memory is one of the most essential cognitive functions our brains perform. 
      It helps us interpret the world, make decisions, and communicate with others. 
      There are many ways to categorize memory, such as separating <strong>short-term memory</strong> and 
      <strong>long-term memory</strong>. Long-term memory can be further divided into two major forms: 
      Implicit Memory and Explicit Memory. Below, we will explore these two types of memory, their differences, 
      how they are developed, and their role in our daily lives.</p>

    <p>According to <a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03198483" target="_blank">Parkin, Reid & Russo (1990)</a>, 
      implicit and explicit memory differ in the way they process and retrieve information. 
      Implicit memory involves unconscious tasks and automatic skills, whereas explicit memory 
      requires deliberate and conscious effort to recall information.</p>

    <h3>Implicit Memory</h3>
    <p>
        Implicit memory, also known as <strong>automatic memory</strong> or <strong>unconscious memory</strong>, refers to the retrieval and utilization of information without conscious awareness. It allows us to perform tasks automatically without deliberate effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of implicit memory include riding a bicycle, playing an instrument, or brushing your teeth. These activities rely on motor skills and habits that we develop through repetition. Implicit memory plays a critical role in many daily tasks.
    </p>

    <h4>Subtypes of Implicit Memory</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Procedural Memory</strong>: Involves learned motor skills, such as walking, typing, or riding a bike.</li>
      <li><strong>Conditioning</strong>: Occurs when a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a specific response, like associating the smell of smoke with fire.</li>
      <li><strong>Priming</strong>: Links one stimulus to another, such as associating "red" with an apple or "green" with grass.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Implicit memory relies on brain regions such as the <strong>basal ganglia</strong>, <strong>cerebellum</strong>, and <strong>motor cortex</strong>. For instance, the basal ganglia supports gross motor functions (e.g., walking), while the cerebellum controls fine motor skills (e.g., holding a pen).
    </p>

    <h4>Development of Implicit Memory</h4>
    <p>
        Implicit memory develops primarily through <strong>repetition</strong> and practice. For example, a toddler learning to walk relies on explicit memory initially, but over time, walking becomes an automatic task stored in implicit memory. This shift allows us to perform tasks effortlessly without conscious thought.
    </p>

    <h3>Explicit Memory</h3>
    <p>
        Explicit memory, also called <strong>declarative memory</strong>, requires conscious effort to recall facts, events, or knowledge. Explicit memory allows us to consciously remember names, dates, or past experiences.
    </p>

    <h4>Subtypes of Explicit Memory</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Semantic Memory</strong>: General knowledge or facts not tied to specific personal experiences, such as knowing the capital of a country or historical events.</li>
      <li><strong>Episodic Memory</strong>: Autobiographical memories of personal experiences, such as recalling your last vacation or the time of your graduation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Explicit memory relies on brain regions such as the <strong>hippocampus</strong>, <strong>prefrontal cortex</strong>, and <strong>amygdala</strong>. For example, the hippocampus is critical for encoding and retrieving episodic memories.
    </p>

    <h4>Development of Explicit Memory</h4>
    <p>
        Unlike implicit memory, explicit memory can form after a single exposure to an event or piece of knowledge. For instance, remembering the date of a wedding or learning a fact in school involves explicit memory. However, these memories can be fragile and are prone to forgetting or distortion if not actively reviewed.
    </p>

    <h3>Differences Between Implicit and Explicit Memory</h3>
    <p>
        Implicit and explicit memory differ in their <strong>conscious involvement</strong>, <strong>retrieval processes</strong>, and the <strong>brain regions</strong> responsible for each. While implicit memory enables us to perform tasks without conscious effort, explicit memory involves the deliberate recall of facts and experiences. Both are critical for our ability to learn, adapt, and navigate the world.
